//! Embedded MJPEG-over-HTTP server. Serves two kinds of source:
//!
//! * **native capture devices** (V4L2 / DirectShow / AVFoundation) — the per-OS input + codec
//!   handling lives in `video/native.rs`.
//! * **RTSP streams whose picture reaches the screen as MJPEG** — either because the source already
//!   sends MJPEG, or because this WebView has no WebRTC and the H.264 has to be transcoded.
//!
//! Spawns `ffmpeg … -f mpjpeg -` and **broadcasts** its stdout to every connected HTTP client as a
//! `multipart/x-mixed-replace` stream on a local port. One ffmpeg decode/transcode fans out to all
//! sinks (panel preview, floating window, dock widget, full-screen swap).
//!
//! Sockets get `TCP_NODELAY` and ffmpeg flushes per packet, so localhost delivery isn't bunched by
//! Nagle/output buffering (which shows up as sporadic stutter, worse at 60 fps).
